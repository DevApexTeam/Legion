DevApexTeam is a MMORPG Framework based mostly in C++.

It is derived from Apex Development, DevApexTeam the Massive Network Game Object Server, and is based on the code of that project with extensive changes over time to optimize, improve and cleanup the codebase at the same time as improving the in-game mechanics and functionality.
